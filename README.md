# llm.java
A Java port of Andrej Karpathyâ€˜s llm.c.

## Quick start
- Clone [llm.c](https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c) and follow instructions given there in README, section [quick start (CPU)](https://github.com/otabuzzman/llm.c/blob/2346cdac931f544d63ce816f7e3f5479a917eef5/README.md#quick-start-cpu). This will get you the dataset, the tokens, the small GPT-2 model (124M) released by OpenAI, and two executables for testing and training.
